Born on **June 3, 1745** in Rochefort (Charente-Maritime district) Latouche-Tréville was considered an exceptional seaman of his time.
Having acquired extensive combat experience in the Seven Years’ War, on September 28, 1772 he was reinstated in the Navy as a “capitaine de brûlot” (fire ship captain) during the Seven Years’ War and earned the command of the fluyt, Le Courtier.
He sailed to the United States on a campaign in **1776** aboard the same ship.

In **1779** he took command of the frigate *L'Hermione*.
After a campaign that lasted several months and a few final adjustments, on **March 20, 1780** he secretly transported the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States to inform Washington of the arrival of French reinforcements.
Following the American victory, he returned to France in late **1781** and finally earned the rank of captain.

Promoted to counter-admiral several years later, he would would have no missions between **1795** and **1800** following disputes with certain ministers.
Decorated by the Légion d'honneur and made a Chevalier of the royal and military order of Saint-Louis and a Grand Officier of the Empire, he died from exhaustion on August 18, 1804 aboard the Bucentaure in the Bay of Toulon, proudly declaring his last words: “An officer of the sea should die under the flag of his ship”.

His name was inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe (north side), and the French Navy named three ships in his honor.
