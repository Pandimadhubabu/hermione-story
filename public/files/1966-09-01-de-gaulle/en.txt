France signed the Geneva Agreements in July 1954 following the defeat at Dien Bien Phu.
France accepted de facto the independence of Cambodia, Laos and the two Vietnamese states, separated by the 17th Parallel.
French Indochina was no more.
A reunification of the two Vietnamese states was then anticipated, but the policy of confrontation of the two blocs would dictate otherwise.

North Vietnam became a communist state, supported by the USSR.
South Vietnam had the backing of America.

From 1960 the pro-American regime had to fight against the communist South Vietnamese, assisted by North Vietnam.
The United States was quick to intervene, and first sent military instructors and then soldiers.
Swept up in the escalation of the conflict and their “domino theory”, the United States bombed North Vietnam in 1965.
This heralded the start of the Vietnam War.
Eager to challenge the blocs and to restore France to a major power, General de Gaulle made a speech in Phnom Penh on September 1, 1966.

>Yes! The position of France is taken. It is the condemnation it brings to current events. (…) Only a political agreement can restore peace, or the universe may slide toward catastrophe.

This speech was received enthusiastically in the Indochinese peninsula and in many third-world countries, but it provoked anger and indignation in the United States.

It had no immediate repercussions.
But when the President of the United States, Lyndon Johnson, announced the “de-escalation of the conflict” and “a forseeable peace”, negotiations took place in Paris.

The Paris Peace Accords were signed in Paris in 1973 that ended the Vietnam War.
