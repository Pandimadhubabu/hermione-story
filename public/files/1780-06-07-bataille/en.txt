On June 7, 1780, four ships were heading for L'Hermione just off the eastern point of Long Island. Alerted by the lookout, Latouche reached for his spyglass and surveyed the horizon:

>I identified a sloop of war, a schooner, a snow and a three-master that I deemed a frigate.

*L’Hermione ship’s log.*

The British! Clear for action!

It was action stations aboard L’Hermione: the master gunner dismantled the bulkeads of the gunroom, the powder was delivered by a chain of sailors, the round balls were ranged in the shot garlands, sand was spread on deck to avoid slipping, grenadoes, muskets and carbines were distributed, and the {MQ}the surgeon’s worktop was set up in the cockpit to tend the wounded.

>I turned on the frigate. I identified this vessel as a frigate with fifteen gun ports open, of which fourteen were equipped with guns with some on her quarterdeck, from her taffrail forward to her mainmast.

*L’Hermione ship’s log.*

The two frigates were then broadside to each other, L'Hermione passed Iris and gave her an entire starboard broadside. The British vessel responded with only several cannon shots. This weak response alerted Latouche; the British ship now had L'Hermione in front of it and could use a quick {MQ}starboard movement to send a massive broadside that would cause extensive damage. Consequently, Latouche reacted with spirit and maneuvered to regain L’Hermione’s position {MQ}off the other vessel’s beam:

>Both sides then opened brisk fire at a range of half a musket shot.

*L’Hermione ship’s log.*

After half an hour of fighting, Latouche realized the British were attempting a new maneuver to take L'Hermione by the quarter.

>I again found myself in a position where all my guns bore on her from bow to stern, as she was fighting me from stern to bow. The battle lasted an hour in such manner with great ardor on both sides, but my fire was superior to the British, and Iris seized the opportunity when I overtook her to back with her {MQ}fore topsail... I fired off three cannon shots which she was unable to return.

*L’Hermione ship’s log.*

The British ship retreated, but L’Hermione had suffered considerable damage:

>... There being the greatest disorder among my sails and in my maneuvers... I fired two hundred and sixty cannon shots, one hundred and forty shots from the {MQ}swivel guns and one thousand two hundred and eighty musket and blunderbuss shots.

*L’Hermione ship’s log.*

The battle ended in ten deaths and thirty-seven wounded on the the French side. Latouche was wounded in the arm, but had gained a victory that would go down in American history.
