Latouche had a ringside seat on the bridge of L’Hermione to witness the arrival of the majestic naval squadron from France:

>… At the same time as myself, moored at the entrance of mouth of the river, L’Amazone, with thirty-two guns and commanded by Mr. de La Pérouse, captain, and the cutter La Guespe with twelve, commanded by the Chevalier de Maulevrier, lieutenant.
The first of these vessels was carrying the Compte de Rochambeau, lieutenant-general of the King’s armies, Grand’ Croix of the Order of Saint-Louis, and commander of the land army.
At 3 o’clock in the afternoon, the breeze having blown in from the sea, the transport fleet entered numbering thirty ships… the warships arrived at 6 o’clock in the evening… the Duc de Bourgogne, with eighty guns, commanded by the Chevalier de Ternay, commodore.
I greeted the General with three cries of “long live the king”, and declared myself ready to receive his orders.
