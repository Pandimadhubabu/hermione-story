James Armistead was born on **December 10, 1760** in Elizabeth City in Virginia.

Born into slavery, in **1781** his owner, William Armistead, granted him permission to volunteer for the army.
He then found himself serving under the Marquis de Lafayette, who sent him on a sensitive mission to infiltrate the British ranks and, in particular, the camp of his sworn enemy, General Cornwallis!

Posing as a fugitive slave, the rookie spy gradually gained the trust of the British and, during the summer of **1781**, his intelligence was so valuable that it enabled the Americans to entrap Charles Cornwallis at Hampton and to win the strategic Battle of Yorktown later on.

After the war, having been refused the right to emancipation, Armistead returned to his former home and to slave labor.
Several years later however, his friend Lafayette met him again in Virginia and decided to do his utmost to help him.
He then drafted a report in his name that would force the General Assembly of Virginia to grant James permanent freedom from his shackles.

Armistead would add the name “Lafayette” to his own as a tribute to his savior, and would have the joy of seeing his friend again in New York in **1824** during the Frenchman’s last visit to the United States.
