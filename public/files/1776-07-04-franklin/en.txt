Born in Boston (United States) on **January 17, 1706** into a modest family of Puritans, as an adolescent Franklin worked as an apprentice printer.
He wrote his first articles for the New England Courant newspaper in **1721**.
An autodidact and inquisitive by nature, he traveled to Philadelphia in **1729** where he published the Pennsylvania Gazette, a successful colonial paper, and founded his own printing house the following year.

A humanist and freemason, he made it his mission to ensure that education and culture was available to all.
He therefore founded literary societies, discussion groups like the “Junto” and the {MQ}first subscription library.

He was also an extraordinary scientist and invented the lightning rod in **1752**, thereby demonstrating the electrical properties of lightning.

Faced with the conduct of the British government, which was imposing ever more stringent tax laws on the colonies, he moved away from imperialism and {MQ}mercantilism in the **1770s** and eventually joined the Patriots at the outbreak of the American War of Independence in **1775$$.

He was elected the representative for Pennsylvania, and was one of the authors of the Declaration of Independence of **July 4, 1776**.

Armed with an impeccable reputation and fierce commitment, Franklin traveled to Paris to persuade the French to send an army and to provide financial support to help the colonists.
This is when he first met the Marquis de Lafayette.

He drafted the first peace negotiations with the British after the American victory at Yorktown.
In **1783** Franklin, along with Adams and Jay, signed the Treaty of Paris, which would end the War of Independence.

On his return to the United States in **1785**, he was re-elected President of the State of Pennsylvania for a term of three years, and participated in the drafting of the American Constitution.

He was therefore the only “Founding Father” to sign the three founding documents of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Paris and the American Constitution.

He died in Philadelphia on **April 17, 1790** aged 84.
