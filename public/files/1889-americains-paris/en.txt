From May 6 to November 5, 1889 numerous attractions caused a sensation, like the Eiffel Tower or Raoul Dufy's painting “La Fée Electricité”.
It was attended by over 60,000 French and foreign exhibitors.
Among them, one American would gain the admiration of journalists, scientists and 32 million visitors alike: **Thomas Edison**.
Visitors were astounded by his phonograph, which was exhibited in the “Galerie des machines”, a large glass and metal pavilion.
Gustave Eiffel invited him to dine in the restaurant on the first floor of his tower as a guest of honor.
The two men ended the evening in the private apartment on the third floor.
Thomas Edison presented him with a phonograph as a token of thanks, which the French engineer used to record around a dozen wax cylinders in 1891.
They are now housed in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

Another American would also attract attention during the exhibition.
This was a certain **Colonel Cody**, known under his more famous stage name of **Buffalo Bill**.
He set up camp in Neuilly-sur-Seine and performed his spectacle: Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.
Bison, horses, Native Americans and cowboys all traveled with him.
The opening performance was on May 18, 1889 in front of the President of the French Republic, Sadi Carnot, and French and American ministers.
This show celebrated America and how the West was won.
It featured reconstructions of historic events such as the Battle of Little Big Horn and traditional scenes from American life, like shooting, rodeos and even baseball matches, a sport still unknown in France.
Buffalo Bill returned to France in 1905 after a tour of other European countries.

The United States had meanwhile become fashionable and was a country that people around the world were finding fascinating.
