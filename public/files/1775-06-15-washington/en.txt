Born on **February 22, 1732** in Pope's Creek in the British colony of Virginia, George Washington had to cope with the death of his father and, still in his teens, he found himself in charge of the rich family property of Mount Vernon in Virginia.

In **1753**, as an adjudant in His Majesty’s army, he was sent by the British Governor of Virginia into the Ohio valley to confront the French.
He was promoted to the rank of officer and took part in the Seven Years’ War between the French and the British **from 1756 to 1763**.
At the end of the war, he returned to his duties as a prosperous tobacco planter among his numerous slaves.

But he was soon caught up in the politics of the day, and was elected representative of Virginia at the Congress of Philadelphia when the American colonies rebelled against the government in London.
Sympathetic to the Patriot cause, he joined the American Revolution and became the commander-in-chief of the American troops on **June 15, 1775**.

On **August 1, 1777** George Washington met a Frenchman who had come to fight on the side of the Patriots; the young and energetic Marquis de Lafayette.
The two men would form a deep friendship that would lead them to fight side-by-side a few years later until the final victory of the Patriots **at Yorktown on October 17, 1781**.

He withdrew to his property at Mount Vernon in **1783** after the Treaty of Versailles which ratified the victory and ended the United States War of Independence.

However, he was drawn back into politics, and in **1787** he was asked to preside over the convention tasked with drafting the American Constitution.
Less than two years later, on **March 4**, he was elected President of the United States, and would serve a second term four years later.

He then retired permanently from political life, and died on his plantation on **December 14, 1799**.

Considered as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Washington has featured on the 25 cent coin and the one-dollar bill since 1932.
