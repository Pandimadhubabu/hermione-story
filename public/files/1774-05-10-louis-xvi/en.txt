Born in Versailles on August 23, 1754, Louis XVI was the son of Louis-Ferdinand of France and Maria Josepha of Saxony.
Married to Marie Antoinette of Austria, he came to the thron when he was 20 years old as King of France and Navarre until 1791.
He was then King of France from 1791 to 1792.

A cautious reformer, he tried to drive forward various reforms to the monarchy with his successive ministers.
He restored the parliaments, reformed the right of individuals by abolishing torture (1781 and 1788) and serfdom in the royal domaine (1779), as well as the abolition of the corporal toll on Jews in Alsace (1784).

He signed the Edict of Versailles in 1787, which allowed non-Catholics to benefit from the civil state without being forced to convert to Catholicism.

Louis XVI was accused of lavish and unneccesary spending (the affair of the queen’s necklace), while the financial assistance to the American patriots had cost over 2,000 million livres up to the peace treaty signed in 1783.

Louis XVI often made a series of blunders and bad choices, notably under the influence of his two brothers, the Compte d’Artois and the Compte de Provence.

The people were angry, which would lead to the French Revolution in 1789.
Louis XVI was arrested in Varennes, but was released on September 14, 1791 on condition that he was faithful to the new Constitution.

The king was imprisoned in the Temple (a medieval fortress in Paris) following the Brunswick Manifesto, which had prompted the storming of the Tuileries Palace on August 10, 1792.

The Republic was declared on September 21, 1792 by the National Convention.
Louis XVI was sentenced to death on January 17, 1793 for “conspiring against the freedom of the nation”.

He was guillotined on January 21, 1793 in the Place de la Révolution (now Place de la Concorde).
