**Society of the Cincinnati** is the oldest lineage society in North America.

The concept was devised by Major General Henry Knox, and the society first met on May 13, 1783 several months before the Peace of Paris that would end the War of Independence. It included distinguished figures from the American Revolutionary War and George Washington was elected the first President General.
High up on the list were the Comte de Rochambeau and the Marquis de Lafayette.

It comprised 13 societies from the states representing the Thirteen American Colonies prior to the constitution of the United States, and a French society called the French Society of the Cincinnati that was founded in the same year and ordained by Louis XVI on December 18.

This French branch was reformed in Paris in 1925 after its members were dispersed in 1792.
Legitimized by the American general society on December 31, 1926, it would be recognized to be of public benefit in 1976.

Still active on both sides of the Pond, the intention of the Cincinnati was to promote values of liberty, initiative, devotion to the common good and responsibility that made the United States so successful.
They also endeavored to maintain the special links forged between the United States and France during the American war that had been deepened during the two world wars.
