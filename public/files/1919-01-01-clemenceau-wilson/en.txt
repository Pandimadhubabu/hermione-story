The Armistice was signed on **November 11, 1918**, and ended 52 months of fighting.
They then had to negotiate and establish the terms of the peace treaty that Germany would have to sign.

The Paris Peace Conference therefore opened on January 18, 1919.
It brought together 32 states that included the five major powers: the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan.
The defeated countries were not invited to the discussions.
France had emerged from the First World War utterly exhausted, bruised and in ruins, with 1.3 million dead and 4.3 million wounded.

Georges Clemenceau would therefore seek to make Germany pay.
But the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, held a very different opinion.
Had presented these in his speech of January 8, 1918: The Fourteen Points.
It proposed a new, European political map based on the recognition of the principle of nationalities and the peoples's right to self-determination.

Disagreements soon arose.
Concerning the future of certain German territories and reparations.
The question of security was paramount for the French.
They wanted to create a protected area, a buffer zone, between France and Germany.

For example, the Rhineland should be separated from Germany and permanently occupied by military forces.
The United States were hostile to this French demand because the US deemed that the inhabitants of the Rhineland were Germans and could not be divided from Germany.
Following the negotiations, the French military occupation was temporary, and would reduce over time.
The at the end of the Peace Conference, the issue of Reparations had still not been resolved.
An advance of 20 billion gold Marks was determined.
But the victors left a Reparations Commission to set the total amount.

The Treaty of Versailles was signed on **June 28, 1919** in the Hall of Mirrors in the château.
Disputes still rumbled on however.
Ratified by French parliament, the Treaty was rejected by the US Senate in 1920.
France was therefore alone in applying the terms of the peace treaty facing its secular enemy, Germany, and its ability and willingness to adhere to the stipulations imposed on it.
