Historians admit that the American revoution appealed to the French.
Numerous intellectuals such as Condorcet marveled at this new political model.
There were indeed many similarities,
but there were also some important differences.

In 1789 the events in America remained the benchmark.
Lafayette became one of the great leaders in the French political scene up to 1791, and saw himself as the French Washington.
Some Americans were present in Paris during the events, and played an important role.
These include Jefferson and Thomas Paine, who in 1792 would campaign for a French republic.
Moreover, the main texts adopted by the revolutionaries in Paris were inspired by the American declarations.
There is a clear parallel between the American Declaration of Independence and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of August 26, 1789 in France.

However, the political evolution of France, which passed from a constitutional monarchy to a republic using terror, severed the ties between French and Americans.
Washington couldn't comprehend the events; Americans viewed Louis XVI as the architect of their independence, and his death by the blade of the guillotine on January 21, 1793 shocked them.
They began to think that the French revolution was taking a dangerous turn.
The new Anglo-French war severed the links between French and Americans, who saw the detrimental effect of the war on their trade.
There were two opposing parties during the American electoral campaigns: the Republicans and the Federalists.
The former were criticized for their modest support of France, while the latter were anglophile.
