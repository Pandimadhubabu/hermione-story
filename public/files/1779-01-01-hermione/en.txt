Her construction completed on 30 April, the frigate L’Hermione passed under the command of the Chevalier Levassor de Latouche.
The Naval Staff quickly decided to send the frigate on a trial campaign and to familarize the crew with the ship.

From May 18 to December 31 1779 Latouche tested his ship out at sea with over 300 men under his orders.
Note that this same year the kingdom of France entered into a new conflict with Great Britain (declaration of war on July 10).
When she returned to port, several modifications were made to L'Hermione, notably to adjust the waterline to the correct height:

>The frigate has been sheathed in copper and eleven hundred sheets have been applied.

This represents nearly six tons, to which seventy-seven barrels of ballast have been added.
The result of the operations: more speed by increasing the slip by reducing the fouling and roughness below the immersed part of the hull.

>The copper sheathing has added much to the qualities of the frigate. Her speed has increased by one fifth and her sails are more efficient… One may consider her as one of the best frigates the king has.”

More efficient, a good crew and an effective naval staff, L'Hermione was finally ready for her great mission!
