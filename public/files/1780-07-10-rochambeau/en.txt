Born on **July 1, 1725** in Vendôme (Loir-et-Cher district), Rochambeau joined the Saint-Simon cavalry regiment when he was 17 years old.
He distinguished himself at the capture of Namur and again in the Seven Years’ War when he was wounded at the Battle of Clostercamp on **October 15, 1760**.
He was promoted to brigadier-general and inspector general of the cavalry the following year.

After gaining the rank of lieutenant-general, he voyaged to the United States in **1780**.
He commanded some 6,000 French troops that were urgently awaited by George Washington and Lafayette.
He landed at Newport, Rhode Island on July 10, but he had to wait a year before engaging in any action with the British.
He would lead this campaign magnificently under George Washington’s command, which would take the troops to the final victory at Yorktown.

American Congress thanked him personally as a token of gratitude.
Upon his return to France, he was honored by Louis XVI, who awarded him the ”cordon bleu” (blue ribbon) and made him the governor of the district of Picardy and Artois.
A man of liberal ideas, Rochambeau was promoted to the Northern army in France in 1791, and was made Marshal of France. He retired in 1792.
He was arrested during the French Revolution in the Reign of Terror, and narrowly escaped the guillotine.

He died on **May 10, 1807** at Thoré-la-Rochette (Loir-et-Cher) during the reign of Napoleon, who paid tribute to this last Marshal of the monarchy.
