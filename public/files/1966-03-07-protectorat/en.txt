Following the Second World War, the security of French territory was assured mainly by the presence of American and Canadian regiments and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.NATO was a military alliance created in April 1949 during the Berlin blockade between the United States, Canada and Western European countries.
It was designed to protect Western Europe against potential aggression from the USSR and/or the democratic republics of Eastern Europe.

However, General de Gaulle, President of the French Republic, could not agree to France being subject to a supranational organization and friendly powers to defend herself.

He had other plans.
He wanted France to become a leading power once again and regain some of her pre-Second World War influence.
But the world order had changed.
Two superpowers and new states had emerged after a series of decolonizations.

France therefore left the military organizations of NATO in July 1966 and all the North American bases were abandoned in April 1967.

France regained its military sovereignty, which didn’t prevent it from remaining a nation allied to the United States and NATO.
France also took part in NATO operations and military missions, for example during the war in the former Yugoslavia and in Afghanistan.

France has been reintegrating into the military structures of NATO since 2009.
