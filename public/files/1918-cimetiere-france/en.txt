After declaring war on Germany in April 1917, the United States sent an expeditionary force to France, commanded by General Pershing.
This number had swelled to nearly 2 million soldiers by October 1918.
They took part in many decisive victories, notably in Argonne.
49,000 American soldiers would lose their lives.

During 1944, thousands of American soldiers took part in two landings in France and the battles that ensued: Operation Overlord in Normandy on June 6, and Operation Anvil-Dragoon on August 15 in Provence.
Over 30,000 American soldiers died in the fighting.
The bodies of 14,000 of them were repatriated and buried in the United States; the others were buried in France.

France has 11 military cemeteries with a total of over 65,000 headstones: eight of these honor the losses in the Great War.
They are: Aisne Marne American Cemetery, Brittany American Cemetery, Epinal American Cemetery, Meuse Argonne American Cemetery, Oise Aisne American Cemetery, Saint Mihiel American Cemetery, Somme American Cemetery, Suresnes American Cemetery.
Three honor the American losses of the Second World War.
They are: Colleville-sur-mer, Lorraine American Cemetery (the larges in Europe with over 10,900 white crosses) and Rhone American Cemetery, near to Draguignan.

Their creation, management and maintenance is the work of the American Battle Monuments Commission, founded in 1923.
This institution is the custodian of all the American cemeteries and commemorative monuments overseas.  
The American military cemeteries in France do not constitute US territory, but concessions granted in perpetuity by the French state.

Veterans Day on November 11 is the date when the last survivors and/or their families come to France to come together and remember these soldiers of Liberty.
