In July 1956, President Nasser of Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal following America�s withdrawal of financial aid for the Aswan Dam project.
But it was owned by an Anglo-French company.

Despite an objection from the United States, France and Britain opted for military intervention in Egypt to overthrow Nasser.
They were joined by Israel, who intended to use the war to eliminate an ally of the Palestinian cause.
This was the start of Operation Musketeer.

Israel occupied the Sinai Desert in October, and in early November the French and British had gained control of Port Said, a Mediterranean port at the mouth of the canal.

This military victory would, however, turn into a diplomatic fiasco.
The international community, UN Resolutions 118/119, strongly condemned this aggression.
The USSR threatened to use nuclear missiles against the two European states.
But above all, the United States deplored the move and pledged they would provide them with no protection.

France and the United Kingdom withdrew their troops in December 1956.
This operation weakened the two colonial powers faced with a third-world country, boosted Nasser�s profile and the two superpowers found themselves face-to-face, alone in the Middle East.
