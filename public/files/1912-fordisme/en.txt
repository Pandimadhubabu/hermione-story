In the early 20th century, the global car market was dominated by Germany and in particular by France and the United States.
Although the United States had overtaken France in world car production in 1904, France remained the leading exporter until 1914.
But all eyes were turned toward the other side of the Atlantic.

Henry Ford was the famous inventor of the Model T, created in 1908 and which sold 15 million vehicles in less than twenty years.
This self-made man was also known for introducing revolutionary methods of mass production inspired by the work on the scientific organization of labor by the American engineer Frederik W. Taylor.

The objective was to improve productivity by streamlining work processes and reducing the movements of the workers (time and motion).
Henry Ford applied and perfected this theory by introducing standardization, a policy of high salaries and production line labor from 1913.
Fordism was born, and would inspire many French industrialists.

In 1911 Louis Renault, founder of the brand of the same name, visited a number of factories in the North of the United states, where Fordism was spreading rapidly.
He returned to France with the idea of imposing the time study method.
The Renault factory in Billancourt responded by a series of strikes during 1912-1913.
André Citroën met Henry Ford in 1912 and visited the factory in Dearborn.
In 1915 he built a plant in the quai de Javel in Paris to manufacture armaments.
The production line was introduced.

The main French car companies ( Citroën, Renault, Peugeot) adopted Fordism in its entirety from the 1920s.

But we mustn't forget that all of global capitalism was influenced by this revolutionary production, management and control system.
