>Nobody can therefore assert today that the path of war will be shorter than that of the inspections. Nor can we assert that it could result in a safer and more stable world. Because war is always the sanction of failure.

Dominique de Villepin outlined and defended the French position to calm and stall American unilateralism to General Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State and other representatives of the UN Security Council.

But on February 5, General Powell produced a dossier against the Iraqi regime, then led by Saddam Hussein, to the same Council.
It contained a large amount of evidence, most of which would later prove to have been fabricated, relating to a massive stockpile of weapons of mass destriction in Iraq.
But this was still contested by France.

On November 8, 2002, Resolution 1441 was passed on the initiative of France.
It assigned two UN inspectors, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, to monitor the “disarmament”.
The Iraqi state had agreed to inspections since 1991.

But the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 prompted American President George W. Bush to intervene.
The United States was forced to act militarily to defend democracy and US interests.
In October 2001, the US army invaded Afghanistan with the agreement of the UN.
However, the two inspectors had not yet completed their mission, nor had they found a secret arsenal of weapons in Iraq.

But it was too late. In March 2003, the United States and its allies invaded Iraq, but without France.
The second Gulf War would have two outcomes:
Expression of anti-French sentiments in the United States during the early years of the war, a split in world and American public opinion, stalemate and military failure, a rise in anti-American feeling and scheduled military withdrawal by President Obama.

But above all, it would force all the states to consider a new world governance.
