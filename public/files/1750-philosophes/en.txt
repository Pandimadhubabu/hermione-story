**John Locke** (1632-1704) was English. A witness to the English Civil War which implemented a constitutional monarchy, he wrote in On Civil Government in 1690:

>The liberty of man in society is to be under no other legislative power but that established by consent in the commonwealth. It is clear, since the absolute monarchy, regarded by some as the only government in the world, is in fact incompatible with civil society.

**Montesquieu** (1689-1755), born in Bordeaux, would expand on this idea by stating in The Spirit of the Laws (1748):

>When in the same person or the same body of magistrates, the legislative power is held in the executive power, there is no freedom (…). All would be lost if the same man (…) exercised these three powers: that of making laws, that of executing public resolutions, and that of judging crimes or personal disputes.

**Kant** (1724-1804), a German, was one of the first to speak of the Enlightenment:

>Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance (…). “Have the courage to use your own understanding” is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.

**Diderot** (1713-1784) published a fundamental article in 1751:

>No man has received from nature the right to command others. Freedom is a gift from heaven, and every individual of the same species has the right to enjoy it as soon as he has the right.

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (1712-1778) would go further and, in addition to liberty, demanded equality:

>If one seeks to define precisely what constitutes the greatest good of all, which ought to be the end of any system of legislation, we find it reduced to these two principal objects: liberty and equality. Freedom, because all private dependence is that much force subtracted from the body of the state; equality, because liberty cannot survive without it.
