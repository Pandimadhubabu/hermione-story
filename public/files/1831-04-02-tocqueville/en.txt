Educated in the strongest Catholic and royalist tradition, like Lafayette, Alexis de Tocqueville became a champion of liberalism. Following a visit to the USA, he published a major work in 1835-40: Democracy in America.

The young Alexis de Tocqueville set off for the United States from Le Havre on April 2, 1831. The aim of his trip: to study the American prison system to improve French jails which were, even at the time, considered breeding grounds for reoffenders. But de Tocqueville was an outstanding observer. He scrutinized how American institutions operated, compared them with their French counterparts and wrote about democracy, the Americans and France. He expressed himself as a man of his time; sometimes critical to the point of shocking.
