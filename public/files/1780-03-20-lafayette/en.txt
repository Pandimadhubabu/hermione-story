Born on **September 6, 1757** at the Château of Chavaniac (Haute-Loire district), the Marquis de Lafayette (full name: Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier) lost his father at a young age, who had been killed in the Seven Years’ War.
The sole heir to a vast fortune at the age of 17, he married a young and extremely wealthy heiress, Marie de Noailles, who would be the great love of his life.
Eager for adventure, he chose a military career and earned the rank of captain.

He met Benjamin Franklin in **1777**, who had come to Versailles on a secret mission to promote the cause of the American patriots.
Convinced of the significance of this rebellion and driven by the desire to do battle with the British, Gilbert left for America aboard the ship “La Victoire” at his own cost and against the advice of many in America.

>A defender of this liberty that I revere I, more than anyone, am free to come here to offer my services to this fascinating republic, and bring with me my ardor alone, with neither personal ambition nor interest; in striving for my own glory I am also striving for their happiness. \[…] The happiness of America is intimately linked to the happiness of all humanity; it is set to become the respectable and safe asylum for virtue, honesty, tolerance, equality and a tranquil liberty.

*(Letter dated June 7, 1777)*

On his arrival in America, Lafayette met George Washington, who would become a second father to him, and humbly offered his services as a common soldier.
Appointed major-general, he quickly distinguished himself with his bravery, and was shot in the thigh at the Battle of Brandywine on **September 11, 1777**.

He returned to France in the spring of **1779** where he received a triumphant welcome, and became an active campaigner for the revolutionary cause.
He persuaded Louis XVI to send 6,000 troops as reinforcements and departed secretly aboard the frigate L'Hermione on **March 20, 1780** to announce the news.

He eagerly participated in the campaign for independence that would end in victory for the patriots at the Battle of Yorktown on **October 19, 1781**.

On his return to France, bathed in glory and honor, the Marquis would then cultivate his thinking and would devote even more effort to serving these ideals.

At the head of the National Guard during the revolution of **1789**, Lafayette would be one of the original members to draft the Declration of the Rights of Man and the implementation of the French tricolor cockade, which would form the basis of the national flag.

But on **July 17, 1791**, under attack from hundreds of radical militants known as the “sans-culottes” (no trousers) on the Champ de Mars, the Marquis ordered the National Guard to open fire, killing 50 demonstrators.

This error of judgment marked a final break between the liberal Marquis and the Revolution.
Threatened with arrest after the {MQ}fall of the monarchy, he was forced to flee.
He was captured and imprisoned by the Austrians, and was released five years later after the Treaty of Campo Formio (now Campoformio) negotiated by Bonaparte.

He withdrew from political life until **1814**, when he finally returned to the scene to vote in favor of the abdication of Napoleon 1st.

His final military fighting took place in the revolution of **1830**, when he was the commander of the National Guard.

He died on **May 20, 1834** aged 77, after an extraordinary life.
