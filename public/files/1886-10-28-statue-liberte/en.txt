The inauguration of the Statue of Liberty took place in New York on October 28, 1886.
It was presented by France to celebrate both the friendship with the United States and also to commemorate the centenary of the United States Declaration of Independence.
The statue was the work of a sculptor from Alsace, Frédéric Gustave Bartholdi.
The internal metal framework was designed by the engineer Gustave Eiffel.
It was the republican representative Édouard Laboulaye who proposed the idea of the gift, which was paid for by the citizens of France and America.
The French frigate L'Isère transported the 350 pieces of the statue stored in over 200 crates to the United States.
It took four months to assemble the 100 tons of the structure and the 80 tons of the copper skin on what was then called Bedloe’s Island, renamed Liberty Island in 1956.
93 meters high with the pedestal, she gazes out toward Europe to her French twin sister on the Pont de Grenelle in Paris.
Her crown has seven rays representing the seven continents and seven oceans, and the chain at her feet symbolizes liberty.
She is holding a tablet in her left arm on which is inscribed:
"JULY IV MDCCLXXVI"; July 4, 1776, the date of the United States Declaration of lndependence.
Adorned with these ideals, the Statue of Liberty has become a symbol of universality for over a century.
Moreover, Chinese fine art students produced a plaster replica of the statue in May 1989 during the events in Tiananmen Square.
